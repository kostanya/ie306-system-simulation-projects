    "SimPy is a powerful discrete-event simulation library in Python that can be used to model and simulate various systems, including queuing systems. \n",

    "This example shows how a simple M/M/1 system (1 server with an infinite capacity queue, exponential interarrival and service times) can be modeled with a process-interaction view using the SimPy library. \n",

    "In this example customers place calls to the call center of a company at random times. There is only a single operator in this call center, and picks up the first call waiting when she is available. "
